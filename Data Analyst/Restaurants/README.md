# Restaurants

### ❓ Problem Statement
Our client would like a dashboard built of their data that shows insights into the various restaurants they own. The data contains information on each restaurant's country,
rating, cuisine, and other features. The dashboard should be able to handle future updates to existing restaurant information as well as newly acquired restauarants.

### 🗄️ Files
* `restaurants.csv` - A dataset of restaurant information
* `country_xwalk.xlsx` - A crosswalk table for country codes

### 🖨️ Expected output
A dashboard built in a tool of your choice that tells a story of the data through charts, tables, and graphs. Any new data supplied later will be have the same schema as the `restaurants.csv` file, but will not be perfectly clean.
