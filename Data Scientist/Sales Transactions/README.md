# Sales Transactions

### ❓ Problem Statement
Our client would like to understand the customer purchase behavior against various products of different categories. They have shared the purchase summary of various customers for
selected high volume products from last month. The data set contains customer demographics, product details, and total purchase amount. They want us to build a model to predict the
purchase amount for each transaction against various products which will help them to create presonalized offers.
