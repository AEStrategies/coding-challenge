# Restaurants

### ❓ Problem Statement
Our client would like us to predict what a restaurant's review score is expected to be before it even opens. They have supplied us with two datasets so that we can train out model.
The data contains information on each restaurant's country, cuisine, and other features.

### 🗄️ Files
* `restaurants_train.csv` - A dataset of restaurant information **WITH** the target feature
* `restaurants_test.csv` - A dataset of restaurant information **WITHOUT** the target feature
* `country_xwalk.xlsx` - A crosswalk table for country codes

---

### 🖨️ Expected output
An updated `restaurants_test.csv` file with an added feature called `Rating`. The feature should be populated with your model's best prediction for each row.
