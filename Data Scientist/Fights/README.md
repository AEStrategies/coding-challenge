# Flights

### ❓ Problem Statement
Our client would like us to predict what a flight's cost is going to be based on various flight information. They have supplied us with two datasets so that we can train out model.
The data contains information on each flight's airline, source, destination, date and time of arrival, and other features.

### 🗄️ Files
* `flights_train.csv` - A dataset of flight information **WITH** the target feature
* `flights_test.csv` - A dataset of flight information **WITHOUT** the target feature

### 🖨️ Expected output
An updated `flights_test.csv` file with an added feature called `Price`. The feature should be populated with your model's best prediction for each row.
